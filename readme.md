First things first, have in your possesion a foam glider and a toy drone that is ready to be ripped apart.

The idea is to disassemble the drone and transfer the electronics directly to the glider.

1) Disassemble the drone.
2) Mark the center of gravity (CG) points on the wing of the plane with no modifications done.
3) Make space in the plane's canopy for the flight controller and the battery.
4) Make two slots in each wing for two motors.
5) Roughly place the electronics on the plane. IMPORTANT: Ensure that the left two motors and right two motors when the drone's forward is facing away from you, is placed on the left and right wing of the plane respectively.
   Also ensuring that the plane's forward is facing away from you. This is how you can get roll control.
6) Move the battery in the canopy until the plane balances at the CG points marked earlier.
7) Glue the motor board and motors down.
8) Tape down the battery and mark its position.
9) Turn on the drone and ensure everything is operational.
10) When left joystick is applied, drone's right motors should speed up and the left motors slow down, and vice versa.
11) Mount the props back onto the motors ensuring the thrust is to the rear of the plane.
12) Test fly, and trim the rear control surfaces till plane flies at level flight when flying near 60% power.

You now hold the baby of a foam glider and toy drone. Happy flying!
